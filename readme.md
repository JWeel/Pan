Oldschool game engine written in java during summer after first year of college (2014)

Recompiled this project from 2014 in 2021:
* Moved all .java files into the same directory
* Ran command `javac *.java`
* Moved the .java and .class files back into original directories
* Ran command `jar cfm Pan.jar MANIFEST.MF Pan.class areas art battle character foundation graphics menus repository sorting`
* In order to run the .jar file (optionally using a console with command `java -jar Pan.jar`), it must be placed in a directory that also contains a directory `src` with inside directory `art` with inside all the .png files
